ipscan requires sqlite3 and its development libraries to be installed on the server which will act as your scanner.

ipscan is known to build on Opensuse versions 11.1 and 11.4 

Steps:
	1. edit the Makefile and adjust the following entries as required:
		a. TARGETDIR - this should be set to the desired location for the cgi files (e.g. /srv/www/cgi-bin6)
		b. URLPATH - this is the URL by which the cgi files will be accessed from your webserver
			e.g. http://ipv6.chappell-family.com/cgi-bin6/ipscan-js.cgi then set URLPATH=/cgi-bin6
		c. SQLITE3BIN - this should be set to point to the location of your sqlite3 binary
		c. TXTTARGET and JSTARGET - these define the names of the two cgi objects that will be created

	2. edit ipscan.h and adjust *at least* the following entries:
		a. EMAILADDRESS - suggest you use a non-personal email address if the webserver will be world-accessible
		b. DBDIR - the sqlite3 database files will be created here - ensure the specified directory exists and is writeable by apache!

	3. edit ipscan_portlist.h and change the list of ports to be tested if required
	
	4. make && make install
	
	5. make sure that the URL path directory (which may well be via an Apache alias) is enabled to run cgi:
	
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin6/ "/srv/www/cgi-bin6/"
	<Directory "/srv/www/cgi-bin6">
        	AllowOverride None
        	Options +ExecCGI -Includes
        	Order allow,deny
        	Allow from 2000::/3
    	</Directory>
	
	6. Browse from a machine that you want testing to http://[server-ipv6-address]/cgi-bin6/ipscan-txt.cgi  

	7. Check the apache access and error logs for messages. ipscan will place summary messages in the error log for all scans.
	
	
For those considering providing ipscan access on the public internet consider adding a landing page which will check for 
host IP address suitability prior to allowing access to the cgi script - most (all) search engine spiders only use IPv4.
